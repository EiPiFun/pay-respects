# Pay Respects

Typed a wrong command? Pay Respects will try to correct your wrong console command by simply pressing `F`!

- üöÄ **Blazing fast suggestion**: You won't notice any delay for asking suggestions!
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Easy to write rules**: You don't need to know Rust. The rules are written in a TOML file that is simple to work with and can be evaluated to Rust code upon compilation! Optional runtime user defined rules can be enabled starting from 0.5!
- üéØ **Accurate results**: Suggestions must pass several conditions in order to be prompted to the user, no `sudo` suggestions when you are using `doas`!
- ü™∂ **Tiny binary size**: Not even 1MB!

## How to Pay Respects

The binary is named `pay-respects`, by adding an alias to your shell
configuration:
``` shell
# Note: You may need to have the binary exposed in your path
alias f="$(pay-respects <your_shell_here>)"

# for example, using `zsh`:
alias f="$(pay-respects zsh)"

# Alternatively, you can also use the following initialization in your config file
# for bash and zsh
eval "$(pay-respects <shell> --alias)"
# for fish
pay-respects fish --alias | source

# for `nushell`, the alias can be added automatically with:
pay-respects nushell
```
You can now **press `F` to Pay Respects**!

Currently, only corrections to `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish` are working flawlessly.

`nushell` is currently usable, but there is no alias expansion, and you will have to put the evaluated initialization command in your config file (added automatically with `pay-respects nushell`). In addition, commands that need to be evaluated in the current working shell (such as `cd`) cannot yet be implemented in `nushell`.

Shell is not obtained automatically through environment variables because it won't work with nested shells, e.g. `fish` inside `zsh` still has `SHELL=zsh`.

## Installing

Install from your package manager if available:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/pay-respects.svg)](https://repology.org/project/pay-respects/versions)

Or if you have cargo installed:
```shell
# install from crates.io
# enabling runtime-rules is optional
cargo install pay-respects --features=runtime-rules

# clone from git and install, suitable for adding custom compile-time rules
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/iffse/pay-respects
cd pay-respects
cargo install --path .

# compile without installing
# binary can be found at ./target/release/pay-respects
cargo build --release
```

Alternatively, you can download Linux binary from [releases](https://github.com/iffse/pay-respects/releases).

## Rule Files

See [writing rules](./rules.md) for how to write rules.

## Contributing

Current option to write rules should cover most of the cases.

We need more rule files, contributions are welcomed!
